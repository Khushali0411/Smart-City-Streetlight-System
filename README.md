# Smart-City-Streetlight-System
| *Research Project*
- **Technology**: IoT
- **Description**: 
This project aimed at creating an energy-efficient smart streetlight system for cities. Using IoT, the system adjusts streetlight brightness based on environmental factors like weather conditions, traffic flow, and time of day, significantly reducing energy consumption.

  **Key Features**:
  - Automated streetlight adjustment based on traffic density and weather
  - Energy-saving algorithms to reduce operational costs
  - Real-time data processing for energy management
